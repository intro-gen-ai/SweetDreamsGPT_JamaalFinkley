This section outlines the purpose, technological foundation, and future direction of Sweet Dreams GPT, aiming to revolutionize bedtime routines for children worldwide.


### Project Outline and Timeline


Sweet Dreams GPT is developed with a heartfelt purpose: to keep the bond between children and their separated parents or guardians strong and vibrant through the power of storytelling.
Technology and Features
Sweet Dreams GPT is built on a state-of-the-art generative AI platform, incorporating personalized bedtime stories, AI-powered illustrations, and voice cloning technology.
Enhanced Content and Safety Measures
To ensure the highest quality of bedtime stories, Sweet Dreams GPT's training data has been enriched with supplementary fairytales and popular bedtime stories from around the world, with increased guardrails to prevent inappropriate content.
Innovative Features and Future Directions
Another feature in development allows users to compile 25 of their favorite bedtime stories into a personalized children's e-book, delivered through Amazon.

"Always and Forever" Feature
Expanding its compassionate reach, Sweet Dreams GPT introduces the 'Always and Forever' feature. This allows AI-generated voice capture to reproduce bedtime stories from a parent, guardian, or grandparent who is recently deceased. The AI technology can reproduce these stories with as little as a saved voicemail, offering a sense of continuity and presence.

## Goals of project 

### Goal 1 Create engaging bedtime stories that make the child the center of the story
### Goal 2 Create illustrations to go with the story that include the child amd the themes of the story
### Goal 3 to create safeguards to prevent hallucinations and story themes that may be offensive to some parents and dangerous for the child
### Goal 4 to use ai voice cloning trchnology to allow for audio playback of the story
 

## Project Metrics 

### Metric 1 - the engagement of the stories 
### Metric 2 - the safeguards are implemented as to not have sexually suggestive content within the stories
### Metric 3 - the voice cloning technology makes a voice that is similar to the source boice

## Self-Evaluation


After beginning the project I started to achieve each goals one by one.   The first of which, to create engaging bedtime stories, I created 64 bedtime stories, 49 of which were to my youngest daughter Naomi age 7 who is who I originally created the program for.  With me being in Nashville TN, and her recently moving with her mother from Southern California to Houston Texas. As a young black girl, I found it difficult to find stories that fit her interest which were in rodeos, horses and farming.   So utilizing Sweet Dreams I was able to create stories in her interest.  I also created stories for Dr. Herbert Marbury, a professor here in the Divinity school at Vanderbilt about his two new puppies Memphis and Freedom.  Two poodles.  I created stories for a number of parents that I sent the software out as test subjects to see if the assistant was useful to them in creating engaging bedtime stories.   For that goal I can say it was accomplished.   

Goal #2 was to create illustrations for these stories and again I was able to accomplish this through the stories I created and giving instructions to Dall-E as to how I wanted these images created.   ![image](https://github.com/intro-gen-ai/SweetDreamsGPT_JamaalFinkley/assets/143116072/fe075c46-75df-4413-913e-24d55b322594)

Goal #3 To create safeguards.  I started by uploading source data, Russian fairytales from my recent course Russ 1874 Russian Fairytales, as well as fairytales from the Brothers Grimm that are the basis for most of our Disney Fairytales, along with African Folklore such as Ananse, a Ghanain Folklore of a spider who has many tales with a moral fiber.  These tales did help create a moral center for my stories but when testing on sexuality I was still able to breakthrough and create inappropriate stories with the correct amount of prompting.

Goal #4 The A.I. cloning, this was accomplished with some code and as long as I had source material to read a script to create the correct amount of phonics needed to clone the voice.  I was able to go beyond that for the Always and Forever feature for those people who are no longer alive, and even clone the voices without the script and just with a minute or so of voicemails.   

As for my metrics, they were achieved through testing.  Parents became my test subjects and creating different stories for their kids was what I needed to know if it was engaging, if the illustrations were good enough, if the stories were safe enough and if the A.I. voice cloning worked.  I had the most difficuties with imaging.  It seemed that even when prompting for a black child DALL-E would create a ambiguous image, or a more fairskinned child than desired for the likeness.  I often had to say "African" in the prompt to get a brownskin child.   I was dissapointed in the imaging.  The voice cloning has been successful.  Even without the script I have been able to duplicate the voice of a friend who's father passed 2 years ago.  When he played the bedtime story back for his wife, and his kids they both recognized the voice as that of their Grandfather/Father in law.

## Reflection on Learning


From this project, Sweet Dreams GPT, the big takeaway for me has been the sheer potential AI holds to deeply personalize experiences and bridge emotional gaps, even in something as timeless and traditional as storytelling. It's not just about automating tasks or crunching numbers; AI can touch the heartstrings, connect families, and bring a sense of presence where it's physically impossible. That's powerful stuff.

This journey into developing Sweet Dreams GPT has definitely shifted my understanding of AI. Before, I saw it mostly as a tool for efficiency and maybe some entertainment. Now, I see it as a companion that can carry on legacies, tell stories, and keep personal bonds strong over any distance. It’s about bringing human elements to technology, making it work for us in very personal, emotionally resonant ways.

Looking ahead, this experience has lit a fire under me to dive deeper into AI, especially around areas that blend AI with the arts and human expression. Whether it's furthering my education, exploring new business ventures, or creating more tools like Sweet Dreams GPT, I'm all in. There’s a world of possibilities for using AI to enhance our human experiences and even to help us retain our humanity in the face of increasing technological advancement. It's about using AI not just to replace what we can do, but to amplify and extend the best parts of us.
## What's Next?
Next up, the journey for Sweet Dreams GPT is all about taking this innovative concept from prototype to product. The plan is to develop a user-friendly interface that's accessible and engaging, making it easy for anyone, from parents to siblings, to create personalized bedtime stories. This means diving into some practical steps like designing the app, ensuring it’s intuitive, and packing it with features that allow users to customize stories deeply.

In terms of technology, the focus will be on selecting the best large language model (LLM) that can integrate seamlessly with our application through its API. This choice will be crucial because we need a robust and flexible AI backbone that can generate rich, diverse, and engaging stories consistently.

Once we've got the tech and interface nailed down, the goal is to launch Sweet Dreams GPT into the market. This will involve a lot of testing, gathering user feedback, and iteratively improving the product. The ultimate vision is to create a platform where storytelling helps maintain and strengthen bonds, no matter the distance—making every bedtime a moment of connection and magic.

    if description_choice.lower() == 'describe':
        child_description = input("Please describe your child's appearance (hair color, eye color, etc.): ")
        child_image = None
    elif description_choice.lower() == 'upload':
        child_description = None
        file_path = input("Please enter the path to your child's photo: ")
        if os.path.exists(file_path):
            with open(file_path, "rb") as file:
                child_image = file.read()
        else:
            print("File not found, please try again.")
            return collect_child_info()
    else:
        print("Invalid choice, please try again.")
        return collect_child_info()
    
    # Collect child's interests
    interests = []
    print("Please enter 4 things that interest your child (e.g., dinosaurs, space, painting, etc.).")
    for i in range(1, 5):
        interest = input(f"Interest {i}: ")
        interests.append(interest)
    
    return {
        "name": child_name,
        "description": child_description,
        "photo": child_image,
        "interests": interests
    }

# Use the function
child_info = collect_child_info()
print("Thank you! Here's the information you provided:")
print(f"Child's Name: {child_info['name']}")
if child_info['description']:
    print(f"Description: {child_info['description']}")
else:
    print("Photo: Uploaded successfully.")
print(f"Interests: {', '.join(child_info['interests'])}")
